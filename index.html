    <h1>Golden Retriever Dogs</h1>
    <p>Dogs belonging to the golden retriever breed are smart family dogs. They have only one request from you: <span class="request">Love.</span> They are hungry to be loved. No matter how much you love them, they get grumpy when you take your hand off them. You will always care and love. I think being loved is more important than food and water for them.</p>
